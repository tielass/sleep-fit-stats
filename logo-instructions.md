To create a logo for your Sleep-Fit-Stats project:

1. Use a design tool like Canva, Figma, or Adobe Illustrator to create a logo
2. Design a simple icon that represents sleep and fitness tracking
3. Use a color scheme that conveys health and wellness (blues, greens)
4. Export as both PNG and SVG formats
5. Place the files in the frontend/public/ directory
6. Name them logo.png and logo.svg

Example concept:

- A stylized bed icon with a heart rate line running through it
- Or a circular progress chart with a moon icon inside
